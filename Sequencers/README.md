# Notes for the Sequencer scripts

## Traveler

Use mouse scroll in the grid to add/remove/modify rovers and obstacles in cells.

Rovers are green arrows that move through the grid at the clock rate and emit notes when striking a grid wall.

Obstacles remain stationary and affect rovers that encounter them.
