# Notes for the Sequencer scripts

## Traveler

Use mouse scroll in the grid to add/remove/modify rovers and obstacles in cells.

Rovers are green arrows that move through the grid at the clock rate and emit notes when striking a grid wall.

Obstacles remain stationary and affect rovers that encounter them. 

## Installation

Copy the Lua scripts and the "_images" folder to the path where Falcon finds user script processors. The "_images" folder needs to be in the same location as the scripts.

For example, on Windows:

*C:/Users/(you)/Documents/UVI/Falcon/User Presets/EventProcessors/Script Processor/tonecaver/Sequencers/Traveler.lua
C:/Users/(you)/Documents/UVI/Falcon/User Presets/EventProcessors/Script Processor/tonecaver/Sequencers/_images*
