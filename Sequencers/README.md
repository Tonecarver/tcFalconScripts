# Notes for the Sequencer scripts

## Traveler

Scroll the mouse wheel in the grid to add/remove/modify rovers and obstacles in cells.

Rovers are green arrows that move through the grid at the clock rate and emit notes when striking a grid wall.

Obstacles remain stationary and affect rovers that encounter them. 

## Turing Machine

Inspired by the various Turing Machine modules available for modular synthesis racks and VCV Rack.
